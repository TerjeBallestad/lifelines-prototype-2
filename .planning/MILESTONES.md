# Project Milestones: Before the Fall

## v1.0 Before the Fall (Shipped: 2026-01-28)

**Delivered:** Complete web prototype validating that MTG color personalities plus minimal configuration create distinct, interesting character behavior.

**Phases completed:** 1-6 (19 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Foundation with MTG color personalities — game loop, time system, character state with observable color profiles
- Autonomous character behavior — Elling gravitates toward Blue activities, Mother toward White/Green
- Complete activity loop with "juice" — skills, resources, floating numbers, celebrations, personality-flavored refusals
- Quest system with auto-chaining — progress tracking and celebration flow
- Crisis sequence validating core thesis — Day 10 crisis reveals skill gaps, shadow state, two endings
- Full gameplay loop — Day 1 through epilogue with replay support

**Stats:**

- 116 files created/modified
- ~4,800 lines of TypeScript
- 6 phases, 19 plans, 24 requirements satisfied
- 2 days from initialization to ship (2026-01-27 → 2026-01-28)

**Git range:** `docs: initialize project` → `docs(phase-6): complete Polish phase`

**What's next:** Playtesting and feedback collection before deciding on v1.1 scope.
